This project is a project template for QtCreator.  
The project created is a much more complete application than the default
projects provided by the Qt maintainers.  In particular:

There is also a Help menu with an About dialog for the application
There is a File menu
	File->Open calls QFileDialog::getOpenFileName
	A "Recent Files" sub-menu 
	File->Save
	File->SaveAs
	File->Quit


Application window geometry is saved/restored

In addition, the project uses CMake instead of qmake for the build system.
