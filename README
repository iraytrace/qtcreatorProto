This project is a project template for QtCreator.  
The project created is a much more complete application than the default
projects provided by the Qt maintainers.  In particular:

There is also a Help menu with an About dialog for the application
There is a File menu with the following menu entries

	Open...  calls loadFile(QFileDialog::getOpenFileName) 
		 Remebers the folder where the last file was opened
	Open Recent ...
		 Can open files that were previously opened 
	File->Save
	File->SaveAs
	File->Quit	closes the MainWindow

Application window geometry is saved/restored

The project uses CMake (not qmake) for the build system.
