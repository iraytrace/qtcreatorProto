-------------  OVERVIEW ------------- 
This repository is a project template for QtCreator.  

The project created is a much more complete application than the default
Widgets projects provided by the Qt maintainers.  Much infrastructure for
opening files, recent file history and About dialogs is already in place.
There are menus for:

File			Help
  Open...		  About
  Open Recent...
  Save
  SaveAs
  Quit

The Application window geometry is saved/restored
The project uses CMake (not qmake) for the build system.

-------------  INSTALLATION ------------- 
To be able to use the project template you must install it into QtCreator
and then re-start QtCreator.  To install check out the repository into the
templates/wizards/projects/qmake folder of qtcreator.  On Windows:
C:\Qt\Tools\QtCreator\share\qtcreator\templates\wizards\projects\qmake

According to http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-wizards.html
you should be able to put it in "the local user's configuration folder, 
    $HOME/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/templates/wizards on Linux and OS X or 
    %APPDATA%\QtProject\qtcreator\templates\wizards on windows"

I have not had success with this.  Let me know if it works for you
