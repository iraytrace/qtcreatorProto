This project is a project template for QtCreator.  
The project created is a much more complete application than the default
projects provided by the Qt maintainers.  In particular:

There is also a Help menu with an About dialog for the application
There is a File menu with the following menu entries

	Open...  calls loadFile(QFileDialog::getOpenFileName) 
		 Remebers the folder where the last file was opened
	Open Recent ...
		 Can open files that were previously opened 
	File->Save
	File->SaveAs
	File->Quit	closes the MainWindow

Application window geometry is saved/restored

The project uses CMake (not qmake) for the build system.

To be able to use the project template you must install it into QtCreator
and then re-start QtCreator.


To install check out the repository into the templates/wizards/projects/qmake
folder of qtcreator.  On Windows:
C:\Qt\Tools\QtCreator\share\qtcreator\templates\wizards\projects\qmake


According to http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-wizards.html
you should be able to put it in "the local user's configuration folder, 
    $HOME/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/templates/wizards on Linux and OS X or 
    %APPDATA%\QtProject\qtcreator\templates\wizards on windows"

I have not had success with this.  Let me know if it works for you
